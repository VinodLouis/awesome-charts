1. Bug fixes and other minor changes: Patch release, increment the last number, e.g. 1.0.1
2. New features which don't break existing features: Minor release, increment the middle number, e.g. 1.1.0
3. Changes which break backwards compatibility: Major release, increment the first number, e.g. 2.0.0
